Iris Flower Classification is a classic introductory project widely used to teach fundamental machine learning concepts such as data exploration, visualization, and applying classification algorithms like KNN, Decision Trees, and Random Forests. Working with the Iris dataset provides a clear, structured way to grasp the essentials of supervised learning. Additionally, Claude simplified this learning journey for me by breaking down complex concepts into manageable steps, helping me focus clearly on understanding each stage—from data exploration and visualization to model evaluation and deployment—in an intuitive and approachable way.
